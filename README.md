## FAQ

#### Why am i using the Multi-Dimensional array in this project ?

To justifying a proper presentation for a tic tac toe game . so that it will look presentable to the user at console .

#### Why am i using the do-while loop ?

Because it's the easiest way in c++ to justify that i can not reach to any conclusion until or unless i have fulfilled the whole conditions .
